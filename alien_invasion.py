ALIEN INVASION - USING PYGAME
Question is gotten from: Python Crash Course EBOOK

In the Alien Invasion project, you'll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game.
The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen,
in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.
At the end of the project,
you'll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in python.

ALIEN INVASION spans a number of different files, so make a new alien_invasion folder on your system.
Be sure to save all files for the project to this folder, so your import statements will work correctly.
    Also, if you feel comfortable using version control, you might want to use it for this project.
    If you haven't used version control before, this is a good time to start.
    
----> PLANNING THE PROJECT <----

1. Player controls the ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.

2. Player can move the ship left right using "A" and "D" keys and shoot bullets using "SPACE" key.

3. When the game starts, a fleet of aliens fill the sky and moves across and down the screen.

4. The player shoots and destryos the aliens.

5. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.

6. If any alien hits the ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.

7. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
